# code-quiz
I created my quiz by first creating a start button and element.  I then created buttons for my answers and made it so after one question is answered another appears.  I put in my functions that if you get a question right a prompt woud appear saying correct; if you get it wrong the prompt would say wrong.  The prompt then ends the game saying how many questions were answered correctly.
